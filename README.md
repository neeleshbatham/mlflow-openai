# MLFlow Integration with OpenAI Models

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of MLFlow for tracking experiments, managing models, and deploying machine learning models developed with OpenAI's powerful tools and APIs. MLFlow is an open-source platform for the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. Integrating MLFlow with OpenAI models allows for efficient tracking of model versions, parameters, metrics, and deployment strategies, facilitating a more organized and scalable machine learning workflow.

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the setup and integration of MLFlow with OpenAI models.
- To track experiments, including parameters, metrics, and outputs using MLFlow.
- To showcase model versioning and management through MLFlow Model Registry.
- To illustrate the deployment of OpenAI models using MLFlow.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- MLFlow
- OpenAI API access

You can install MLFlow and other required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install mlflow openai
```

## How to Run
To utilize this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Navigate to the directory and run main.py
3. Follow the instructions within each script or notebook to run the demonstrations.

## Example Usage
Here's a quick example to get started with logging an experiment using MLFlow and an OpenAI model:
```python
import mlflow
import openai

# Your OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = 'your_api_key_here'

# Start an MLFlow experiment
mlflow.start_run()

# Log a parameter (example: model type)
mlflow.log_param("model_type", "text-generation")

# Perform model operation (example: generate text)
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci",
  prompt="This is a test prompt",
  max_tokens=50
)

# Log the model output as a metric
mlflow.log_metric("text_length", len(response.choices[0].text.strip()))

# End the MLFlow run
mlflow.end_run()
```
